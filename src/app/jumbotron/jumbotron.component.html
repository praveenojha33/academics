  <p class="lead"><p>The Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology, Gorakhpur is a preferred academic institute for a large number of organizations for recruiting B.Tech., M.Tech., MCA and MBA students. These organizations influenced by the capability, intellect and the professional readiness displayed by our students, have usually offered more jobs than they originally intended. From most of these organizations, we get to know many good things about the actual performance of our students. 

We have one of the best set of facilities the campus recruiters would like to have and we will be only pleased to make them available to the participating organizations. We also follow a simple and transparent placement policy. We welcome any suggestion from your organization that may help us realize our cherished goal of achieving the best match between the capabilities of our students and the needs of the organizations. We look forward to having your enthusiastic participation during the current session.
